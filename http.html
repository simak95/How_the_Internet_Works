    <p><h4>What is HTTP?</h4></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">

    <p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages
        using hypertext links. HTTP is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked
        devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over HTTP involves a
        client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.</p>

    <p><h4>What is HTTPS?</h4></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="/images/https.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" width="1000" height="250">
    </div>
    <p>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to
        send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data
        transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank
        account, email service, or health insurance provider.
        Any website, especially those that require login credentials, should use HTTPS. In modern web browsers such as
        Chrome, websites that do not use HTTPS are marked differently than those that are. Look for a green padlock in
        the URL bar to signify the webpage is secure. Web browsers take HTTPS seriously; Google Chrome and other
        browsers flag all non-HTTPS websites as not secure.</p>

    <p><h4>HTTP vs HTTPS?</h4></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="/images/http-vs-https.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" width="1000" height="250">
    </div>
    <p>HTTPS is not a separate protocol from HTTP. It is simply using TLS/SSL encryption over the HTTP protocol. HTTPS
        occurs based upon the transmission of TLS/SSL certificates, which verify that a particular provider is who they
        say they are.</p>
    <p>When a user connects to a webpage, the webpage will send over its SSL certificate which contains the public key
        necessary to start the secure session. The two computers, the client and the server, then go through a process
        called an SSL/TLS handshake, which is a series of back-and-forth communications used to establish a secure
        connection.</p>
