    <p><h4>What is W3C?</h4></p>

    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international organization committed to improving the web. It is made
        up of several hundred member organizations from a variety of related IT industries. W3C sets standards for the
        World Wide Web (WWW) to facilitate interoperability and cooperation among all web stakeholders. It was
        established in 1994 by the creator of the WWW, Tim Berners-Lee.</p>
    <p>The mission of the W3C is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing relevant protocols and guidelines.
        This is achieved primarily by creating and publishing Web standards. By adopting the Web standards created by
        the W3C, hardware manufacturers and software developers can ensure their equipment and programs work with the
        latest Web technologies. For example, most Web browsers incorporate several W3C standards, which allows them to
        interpret the latest versions of HTML and CSS code. When browsers conform to the W3C standards, it also helps
        Web pages appear consistent across different browsers.</p>

    <p><h4>What is HTML?</h4></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="/images/html.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" width="1000" height="250">
    </div>
    <p>HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language" is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These
        websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the
        basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is
        constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet
        audience under the direction of the Â» W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the
        language.</p>

    <p><h4>What is CSS?</h4></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="/images/css.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" width="1000" height="250">
    </div>
    <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets". It is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
        including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such
        as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based
        markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across
        pages, and tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of structure (or:
        content) from presentation.</p>
