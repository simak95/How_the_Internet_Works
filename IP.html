        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">IP address stands for Internet Protocol address which is a numerical label
        assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It was intended for communication purposes and was created 
        by Vincent Cerf and Bob Kahn. IP addresses are assigned to devices such as laptop, mobile phones, or Desktop PC etc.  </p>

            </figure>
            <p class="container-fluid text-justify">There are 2 types of IP addresses there is IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 uses 32-bit
            address space and can consist of a host ID for example 192.168, and a NetID which can be 1.1 making the entire IP
            address 192.168.1.1. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address space IP address and is the successor to IPv4. The reason for that
            is IPv4 has only 4 Billion IP addresses to offer but that was back in 1973 when it was designed and is not capable 
            with the demand of todays network. IPv6 offers 340 undecillion addresses and only 20% of today’s internet utilizes 
            that form of IP. </p>

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">How does IP addresses connect devices to the internet, devices like a smart 
        phone or laptop are connected to Wi-Fi and the WIFI or comes from an ISP (Internet Service Provider) that connects 
        you to millions of sites throughout the network. Every device on the internet has a IP address assigned and those 
        addresses use either static IP or dynamic IP. Static is when a device is registered with an IP address which are used
        by corporations and dynamic IP is typically used by consumers who have a leased IP address due to having a shortage of 
        IPv4. The Internet is a design philosophy and architecture that follow a set of protocols, protocols are a set of rules
        and standard used to communicate between machines.   </p>

        <p class="container-fluid text-justify">IP addresses are a set of numbers like a mailing or street address, you don’t 
        need to know the name of the person who you’re sending the mail too but just the address. For example, if you send a 
        letter you need your home address and the person, you’re sending to the destination address. Same goes to IP address 
        your host address goes to a destination address which is someone computer and the letter is the packet that goes back 
        and forth to both computers.</p>
